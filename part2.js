//Part 2: Expanding Functionality

// Declare a variable that stores the number of columns in each row of data within the CSV.
let numberOfColumns;


/*Instead of hard-coding four columns per row, expand your code to accept any number of columns. This should be calculated dynamically based on the first row of data.
Store your results in a two-dimensional array.
Each row should be its own array, with individual entries for each column.
Each row should be stored in a parent array, with the heading row located at index 0.*/
